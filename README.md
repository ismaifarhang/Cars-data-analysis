# Cars Data Processing in Excel
The document has been updated to include the exploratory analysis on car manufacturers and the process for creating unique IDs for all cars. Let me know if there are further refinements or additions you'd like to make!

## Content of Table
### Sheets Included in the Excel File
1. **Raw Data**: Contains details of various cars, including make, model, year, and performance metrics in seprated CSV file
2. **Data Processing**: Processes data on Car IDs and Make a Uniqu IDs.
3. **Pivot Tables**: Summarized Sum of Miles per Drivers and so on..
4. **Charts**: Graphical representations of data, such as bar charts and scatter plots.



## Project Overview
The Cars Data Analysis project aims to evaluate vehicle performance, identify market trends, and assess the impact of various factors such as engine specifications, mileage, and price. The analysis is conducted using Excelâ€™s data processing, visualization, and summary tools to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Explaining Project 
### Raw Data Sheet
This sheet contains detailed car information, including:
- **Car Specifications**: Make, model, year, engine type, horsepower.
- **Performance Metrics**: Mileage, speed, and fuel efficiency.
- **Pricing Data**: Market prices based on car condition and location.

### Processing DATA
An interactive overview processing:
- Funcations: Make it sperate into defferent columns such as Model and Full Model and etc.
- Calcuation: caculate data by year, age, make, or engine type.
- Summaries and leaderboards for quick decision-making and make new Car IDs.

### Pivot Tables Sheet
Summaries created using pivot tables include:
- Sum price by car Miles and Waranttee.
- Fuel efficiency trends by engine type and year.
- Top-performing cars based on mileage and horsepower.

### Charts Sheet
Visual insights represented through:
- **Bar Charts**: Comparison of car prices across makes and models.
- **Line Graphs**: Trends in fuel efficiency over the years.
- **Scatter Plots**: Correlation between mileage and price.


## Result of Project
The Cars Data Analysis project provides:
- Identification of top-performing cars based on user-defined metrics.
- Trends in the automotive market, such as rising fuel efficiency.
- Strategic insights into pricing variations by make, model, and year.


## Recommendations
Based on findings:
1. Highlight top-performing models in marketing campaigns.
2. Focus on improving fuel efficiency and pricing strategies.
3. Utilize insights to target specific customer segments based on vehicle preferences.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset: Analysis depends on the completeness of the raw data.
- Generalized trends: Insights may not be accurate for niche markets.
- Static visuals: Real-time analysis or updates require manual adjustments.
